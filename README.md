# Manage-Employee-Records
This is a simple app used to manage employee records. You can add an employee, delete them, update their record and most importantly print a report about them. 

I have used a database to store their record, Microsoft SQL.

More changes will be communicated through the commits. The errors fixture will be also communicated the same way
